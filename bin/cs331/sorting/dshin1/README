Project 1
Sorting with Insertion sort, Merge sort, MergeInsertion sort, quick sort, and quickSortRandom.

main.java is hard-coded to test all algorithm with a random element size of 4096 and display to the console screen, the time in nanoseconds one algorithm takes to sort the list.
SortTest.java can also run on its own and will test all algorithms with a random element size of 4096, and it is aided with the help of JUnit 4.
	The size of random elements to be tested can be changed to the user's preference. 
	
This project has been compressed after cleaning the project and fixing all known errors.
